# CDBA-A-Novel-Multi-Branch-Feature-Fusion-for-Emotional-EEG-Recognition
This paper proposes a CNN-DSC-Bi-LSTM-Attention (CDBA) model based on EEG signals, which includes three feature extraction channels for automatic emotion recognition. Taking the original EEG signal as input, the EEG signal features are extracted and spliced through multiple branches, and the feature weights of each channel are allocated through the attention mechanism layer. Finally, the EEG signals are classified into three , four and five categories using Softmax. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed CDBA model, experiments were carried out on the SEED and DREAMER dataset.
